##### Summary & Intention
On September 12, 2023, the Committee on Sanitation and Solid Waste Management held an oversight hearing on DSNY's initiatives to address street cleanliness. In addition, the committee heard a series of legislation related to other sanitation concerns (for a full list see the recommendations section).

The data team provided analysis on: 
- The prevalence of several types of sanitation issues by referencing 311 complaints and OATH violations
- Areas of concern, particularly exploring the relation of areas where businesses are to commercial waste

Using data from OATH, 311, and data sources related to where businesses are, we explore the prevalence of sanitation issues and identify areas that need additional support from DSNY. 

#### Main Takeaways
- Dirty conditions were the most prevalent issue in our analysis, receiving both the highest number of OATH violations and 311 complaints. While most NYC streets have few dirty sidewalk OATH violations, less than three, there are eight streets that have more than 50 violations per total number of properties on that street.
- The proportion of OATH violations that go to businesses is xxx. The businesses with the most dirty sidewalk violations/complaints are located in Southwest Queens on Rockaway Parkway, with 70 complaints per business, and in Floral Park on Union Turnpike with 50 violations/complaints, also in Queens.
- 311 derelict vehicle and illegal dumping calls have increased over time but have had fewer OATH violations issued. There were 18 derelict vehicle calls and 39 illegal dumping calls for each violation made. While there was only 1 dirty conditions call for every 4 violations.
